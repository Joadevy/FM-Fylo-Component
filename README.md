## Overview
This is my solution to the [Fylo data storage component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n). 

### The challenge

- Reply the design of the component as well as possible and make it responsive for 375px and 1280px resolutions.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties.

### What I learned

On this project I learned about SASS, it's my first time using this technology and it was really cool. I used it to nesting and module my code. I know this technology has many more uses but for my first time it's fine, I'll keep working on it.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs. I want to learn git too because it's important and useful for co-working. I'll working on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [Cliph-path maker](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - This helped me for apply a polygon decoration in a button of "GB Left". I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
